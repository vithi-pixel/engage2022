1.First start by installing Annaconda navigator from browser

2.create a conda environment through command prompt using command - conda create --name 'env-name' and activate that environment using command- conda activate 'env-name'

3.I have used python so make sure that python is installed and if not you can install it using the command - pip install python

4.In the environment install all the libraries which is also mentioned in Github file requirements.txt

5.Install all the libraries like streamlit, plotly ,pandas, json-server using command -pip install 'lib-name'
(you can even check if the streamlit is installed successfully by using command - streamlit hello)

6.Now the setup is complete

7.Using the cmd remain in the created environment and go the folder in which the file app.py is present

8.To run the file use command - streamlit run app.py

9.As soon as this runs you will be automatically redirected to the localhost where you can see the web app running.
